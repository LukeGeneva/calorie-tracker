Calorie Tracker (name subject to change) is a different way to track calories consumed.

The app attempts to make managing your caloric intake easier by distributing your allowed calories throughout the day. You set times for an eating "window" and the maximum amount of calories you wish to consume in a day. At the beginning of the window, the application will begin accruing calories at an even rate.

The idea is that if you only consume the amount of calories you've accrued or less, you will never go over your calorie limit. It also carries the added benefit of keeping you from eating a large number of calories early in the day and then struggling to limit yourself throughout the afternoon and evening hours.
